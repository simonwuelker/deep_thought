# Deep Array
This is a custom, high-performance array library targeted at my [deep learning library](https://www.github.com/Wuelle/deep_thought).
Because of this, its going to specialize in Level 3 BLAS Operations (`gemm`).

I am currently writing a blog about the development of this crate, you can find it [here](https://wuelle.github.io/array_docs).
